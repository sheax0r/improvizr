# What is this thing?

Improvizr is an app to help you do improv exercises.

Right now, all that it does is generate random combinations of adjectives and jobs, to help give you ideas for your scenes. It looks like this:

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/gpgenv/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request to this repo.

Contributions to [jobs.txt](data/jobs.txt) are especially welcome, but I'm also happy to consider PRs expanding the scope of what this app actually *does*.

## Under the hood

The initial skeleton for this project was adapted from [sinatra-bootstrap](https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/sinatra-bootstrap).

Improvizr uses [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) for the backend and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for its pretty buttons.
